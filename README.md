HireIT is a full-stack Java Spring Boot and React application that streamlines the job hiring process from posting to placement.
On the backend, I built REST APIs with Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and a secure JWT-based authentication system to manage job listings, applicants, and recruiters. On the frontend, React delivers a responsive, user-friendly interface for browsing jobs, applying, and tracking applications.

I used PostgreSQL as the database, containerized with Docker for easy deployment, and AWS S3 for resume uploads. Recruiters get real-time applicant data, filtering, and status updates, while candidates enjoy a clean, guided application flow.

From a learning perspective, HireIT made me apply full-stack principles — designing APIs, securing them, integrating with cloud storage, and delivering an interactive UI. It’s production-ready, scalable, and demonstrates my ability to architect, implement, and deploy an end-to-end enterprise-style application
